“A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some
class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in
T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.”
    Tom M. Mitchell

You will implement a simple linear regression with a single feature - in this case, the
mileage of the car.
To do so, you need to create two programs :
• The first program will be used to predict the price of a car for a given mileage.
When you launch the program, it should prompt you for a mileage, and then give
you back the estimated price for that mileage. The program will use the following
hypothesis to predict the price :
estimate Price(mileage) = θ0 + (θ1 ∗ mileage)
Before the run of the training program, θ0 and θ1 will be set to 0.


The second program will be used to train your model. It will read your dataset file
and perform a linear regression on the data.
Once the linear regression has completed, you will save the variables theta0 and
theta1 for use in the first program.
